is an application that saves all the text in the photo to the database.
I want the user to enter the user's name to know on whose behalf the user will be registered or whose records will be pulled from the database. I save it to the application with hive.
After selecting whether the user will upload a photo or take it from the camera, I show the text and photo on the result page. when the saving process is to be done, I create a collection called the name in the hive and save it in it. when we come to the home page, when we first log in and after the registration, I show the user the saved photo and the saved text.
